title: The Massacre of Orlane
---
At the farmhouse, Zera discovers a few traps which Grin triggers. Inside we find a carved bone statue, a copper chalice, golden locket with portrait, two silk handkerchiefs, and a golden bracelet worth 25g apiece. We also find a scroll of earthen grasp, a potion of greater healing, and a quiver of superior arrows. We then head back to the temple to rest. Checking Misha's wound, it appears to be caused by a weapon coating. I cast lesser restoration to remove any disease or poison.

The following day we work our way around the eastern side of town towards the blacksmith's. There was a struggle inside, but no body. In an adjacent yard we see giant carrion crawlers and bodies covering the ground. Amongst them I find Allia and Ellie. We enter the townhall which is a wreck similar to the Rector's. Reading the town's ledger, there had been regular reports then a change to bland gray descriptions a few weeks ago. Early entries talk of the temple being rebuilt. Then records of people looking for an old temple in the swamp, and a strange wizard passing through.

After reading, I storm across the road towards the Golden Grain tavern. Inside, we find four strong troglodytes. Upstairs is a mess; there was a makeshift altar on the walls. I find a small magical amulet that ticks as whirs. In his disgust, Zera sets the tavern aflame. We head down the road to the south about an hour, then follow the trail leaving blazes until mid-afternoon when we turn back and return to town.

That night I bury Ailla with Ellie in her arms. Despite everyone's protest, we spend the night at the temple. The next day we build a pyre and burn the bodies of the slain.
