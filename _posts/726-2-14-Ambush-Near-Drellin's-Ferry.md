We traveled for a few days (how many??), the air got drier and drier and the towns got smaller and smaller. We passed many abandoned farms, and just outside of Drellin's Ferry near an abandoned farm we're ambushed by orcs about mid-day. Ethor was killed in the ensuing fight. The big beefy orc had an insignia of a big red hand on his chest. In the corner of the house, we find 70g, 900s, 2200c, 3 chaldony (50g ea.), and the Shield of the Black Eye.

While Zera and Grin buried Ethor, Atticus and I watched the roads. It looked like there was normal travel/traffic along the road; no indication we had entered an orc controlled area. We decide to make camp for the night. I cast gentle repose on the orc with red hand insignia, possibly to use as a ploy to provoke in-fighting. Entering Drellin's Ferry the guards aren't too receptive to our presence. Tell us to talk to Cpt. Soranna at Old Tollhouse where I notice the old dwarven stonework.

We learn there are three different warbands approximately 50 in size. Told that controlling Vraath Keep may be useful in keeping the western road open. Council emphasizes the need to keep the western road open for trade to keep the town viable. Told to seek out Jorr, cabin out of the way, if we need to head out to Witchwood, he's the best guide available.

We go to Jorr, ask him to guide us to Vraath Keep; charges 5g/day or 10g if dangerous. We head out to camp along the way. Come across a hydra lying next to a sunken cart along with several orc bodies. Loot 5 bloodstones (50g ea) from a chest. Make camp and are attacked by two trolls.
