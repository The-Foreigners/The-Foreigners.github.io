Once we arrived in Kuldara, we all had business to attend to. Zera immediately head to the Whihite Dove inn to have a proper bath. We follow Grin to Ralph's music shop to purchase a lute. We got a recommendation to visit Cary a dwarven metalsmith, who has a crossed-hammer sign, to purchase armor. She has a nice dwarven-style set of plate armor that she will customize over night. Atticus leads us to Isabella's to find chain jewlery to wear a signet ring around his neck. Grin asked about the ring, and Atticus responded with a question asking if he was also a bastard child. Leaving the shop we find Ethor gnawing on a blue and gold javelin. We then head to the tailor Annan, a rather flamboyant dragonborn, to get Atticus a new traveler's cloak. In the window was a fancy garmet, the "Blue Rider", which was a special order from royalty to reward someone for saving one of the Duke's sons.

We then head to the temple quarter. At the Academy of Wizards, Brenian tells us to speak with Samuel, who would see us in an hour. In the meantime, we head to the Grand Library. I ask about Rhestilor and am quickly sushed, "No one talks of Rhestilor.", and we're escorted to a secret room. We're told that the Dukes have been trying to scrub it from history; that there was once four Dukes, and the fourth was asking for aid from the others.
