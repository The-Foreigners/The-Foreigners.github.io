title: Enroute to Witchcross

The note from the Academy says that they haven't heard from Primo, and will forward any news. They are concerned, and this is a bad development.

We followed the tracks of the orc raiding party which generally followed the road. We traveled carefully and at around 10am we hear shouts and crude laughter over a hill. We saw five orcs and one ogre tormenting two human bodies around a ruined farmhouse. We attacked but are ambushed by four dragonmen and two barghasts. We looted 30g. Atticus and I flew up and saw a fort under attack an hour away. 

When we arrive we see that there are orcs in the fort and that it is Thayne leading the attack, along with a man wearing the 'Blue Rider' outfit. We learn that there are Toothsharps in the fort. Grin approached, yelling "Gruul come out to speak to your son!" Grin pleads, "Humans can't be so bad if you had a son with one!" Grin went inside to negotiate. Grin tells us that Nyett said they have nothing to go back to. They had to ban together to stop Azarr, but everything was destroyed. She called him the 'Blue One", a half orc / half blue dragon. The Toothsharps are in dire straights, there is no food.

Nacore, the Blue Rider, has a bag that connects to a warehouse that could supply food, but will instead come and summon a magic mansion to feed the Toothsharps. He said he thinks magic is just tricks, that he has a magic scroll that displays a new spell every opening. He found the scroll in the hoard of the Great Red Dragon. He was Mealton the Great's court wizard!

Thayne said the army lays on this side of the Witch Stream, and they've begun evacuating the town. Will try and hold them at stream until fully evacuated.

Nyett asks us to free them from their honor binds; sever the head of Azaar. He is at the Nightmare Ridge near the Fane of Tiamat. He's working to summon Tiamat. She tells us that the blue dragon is always with him. Ulumai always... (??)

We got cleaned up and feed. We came across a mysterious grove with an orc raiding party mutilating a caravan. We found a letter of orders for mercenaries in Hadon's Cross. We split up, Zera and Atticus head towards Hadon's Cross with the payment for the mercenaries, and Grin, Thayne, Martin, and I head back from reinforcements.

During camp, we're attacked by a deadly ten-headed hydra, which Thayne novas.
