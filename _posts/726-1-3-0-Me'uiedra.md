We make the Duke's Road, and while travelling we came upon a corpse and a dead horse rittled with arrows lying in the road. Some distance away is an overturned cart with a goblin underneath. After some struggle, we flipped the cart revealing a hidey-hole underneath. Zera guarded up top, while the rest descended to kill off remaining goblins.

We arrive in Me'uiedre as Olanays' father was coordinating a rescue party. Edgar, the blacksmith, is grateful for our aid and offers to customize our armor and sell Grin a weapon. He says goblins and bandits are a problem, especially in Phandalin a town to the Northwest. The town is about a half a days travel west then head right off the road and will make it there by nightfall. When we mention the goblin tower he says we should tell the Reeve, who often makes rounds but can be found in the inn. Finally, he says Fort Felix is bringing in a lot of business. The fort is also called Kordis, but was built by General Felix who drove out a lot of problems from the area. He recommends we ask soldiers in the area about it.

We returned the dwarf corpse to Jorsola, the baker's wife. She says Jeseph was fleeing trouble in the Southeast where people are acting strange in the town of Orlane. She says we should stop by to see her in the morning.

We stop by the temple to make introductions and meet Father William. He offers temple services and a room for me to stay in. He also brings me letters.

We go to the inn, which is busy for the early afternoon and full of soldiers. Ordered a few rounds, bouncer is a booze ooze name Sothas. Met Gale Finly, a realm soldier, and Captain Calvin Dega, a Duke's soldier often used for quelling disturbances. They had heard of a disturbance but weren't forthcoming. Calvin won't say what to stay away from, but is very upset when hearing about goblins. Finally, Dega says they will be escorting General Felixeo Stegati to the southern front to fight orcs. The southern front is reportedly to be surprisingly quiet; letting orcs fight amongst themselves. That the move must be political, to get Felix out of the limelight and that there should be a new general in a few weeks. Dega takes us behind the inn and tells us of the gobins of the Cragmaw tribe took the tower and the Goblin King is in Phandalin further north.

I heard dice rolling in a back room when reentering. Find out that we are currently in the realm of "The Clock", and that "The Neighbors" in the Dutchy to the west. Zera was approached by a man who recognized him and will trade silence for completeing a few tasks: reestablish "Music" foothold in Orlane, deliver package to Glasstaff in Phandalin, deliver letter to Hommlet.

Meet a blue dragonborn, Reeve Katalin. She's upset that Olanys now wants to be a Reeve and is now her apprentice. She tells us of the goblin in Phandalin, where there's also an incursion of bandits and Glasstaff is their leader. She says everyone is headed to Hommlet for riches rumored to be in the Moathouse.

Finley says she is headed due east to Fort Felix and will return in ten days and says that if we go a couple hours east then head north we will make the guard tower by nightfall.

Finally, we enjoyed Edgar's hospitality for the night.
