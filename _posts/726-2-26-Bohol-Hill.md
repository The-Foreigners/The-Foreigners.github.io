Traveling during the day we fight four giant crocidles at a stream crossing, push an extra hour of travel. During the night's watch, Grin heard a pop and sizzle. Investigating he found a scorpion with riding gear dissolving on a hill, and a draconic shape. After fighting the razorfiend, the group of scorpion riders from ealier approach. A dragonborn guts the razorfiend and finds a ring. They request that we accompany them to their camp. We ride on their scorpions north/northeast through the night. We awake in the swamplands, keep going to Bohol Hill (the closest they get to civilization), and arrive late that day. After careful observation, I learn to ride and handle the scorpions.

Bohol Hill has a temple, townhall, and house above a pool. Entering the house, there is an ancient tiefling and a younger tiefling. Selaria Atteco, speaker for Berge Cathriey, and Highsinger Trelata Nightsinger. They are only interested if we are fighting the lizardfolk, unconcerned with the invading orcs. I show them the medalion of tiamat, as we're warned that we'd have been killed if we had shown that to the dragonborn. They are concerned with the black dragon near Rhest. The find that if we attack dragon useful. They don't got to Rhest, that's where the lizardfolk go. They say that a clever orc has taken over Rhest, a dark power. The orc and dragon are living in the same building. They tell us the history of Rhest, a once powerful city that clashed with a druidic tribe. The tribe died, the city was decimated. The weakened city fell pray to orc attack, they broke a dam that protected city and it's now flooded. They leave the place alone, it's a human city and they wish to respect the dead.

We guy 50g worth of spirits and four healing potions. We attend the funeral. Zera sings very well during the wake, so does Atticus. We learn that the group was ousted by the Marrows (Zera's last name). Using the spirits, I use divination to ask what would help us in our fight. I'm told "Don't let them ring the bell." We stay the night in the guest tents.
