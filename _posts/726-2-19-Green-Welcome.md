We stopped by Sterrel's Provisions before the council meeting, we got four horses for each of us along with riding saddles with bit and bridle, saddlebags with 3 days of feed. Then we made a quick stop by Seterin the Wise to purchase some anti-toxin.

We met at the Speaker's House for the town council meeting. In attendance: Cpt. Serena, grim believes we can't win but will do what she is told; Kellin, an innkeep, believes we should send emissaries and make peace like they have done in the past; Delora, owner of a livery, recommends we flee; Iormel, a person of property, favors fighting; and Norro Wistin, the speaker, is undecided. There is the town guard with 25 warriors and a militia of 88 commoners and 30 warriors. After some persuasion, it was decided that they will leave behind a rear guard to slow down the assault and allow the civilians to flee. They will destroy any war material/provisions that they would leave behind. They will scuttle the ferry when orcs are spotted.

After the town council meeting we awoke in a pit inside the basement of a building. After dispelling a few antimagic zones, we spiderclimbed out. We got the drop of a few unsuspecting captors and eventually take on a whole backroom full of them. We fought our way out, looting 2 potions of 'green wave' and a pouch with 600g. They had been asking what the town council knew about their operation. We found a signet ring that Zera recognized as a group he's delivered to. Inside a barrel we found a 'Dread Helmet' and a magic spice pouch. We exited the building through a crowded tavern pretending to either be cleaners or patrons. The sign; along the town square, for the building read 'Green Welcome'.

We stayed the night in the inn and headed towards Skull Gorge in the morning. Towards the end of the day, we came to a split in the road, and we took the path to the right. The trail stopped at an old abandoned wooden fort with a burning fire pit in the center with a giant sitting, roasting a boar. Atticus spoke with Warklegnar, and initially convinced him to let us camp the night, and eventually convinced him to gather his kin at Brindol and help fight the orcs.

We woke the next morning and headed for the bridge. There were four towers with orc guards and a green dragon, hellhounds at the ends of the 10ft wide bridge. There were four tents on the far side with a camp of orcs. A well placed fireball wiped out the far camp, while Grin rushed the center of the bridge to fight the dragon while the rest of us took out the orcs in the towers. When the dragon started to flee, Grin chased it down, jumping in the air and stabbing it in the neck, killing it. We captured a single orc, before we could interrogate him he jumped to his death. We looted 6 pearls worth 100g each.

We camped the night at the tower, fighting a gray render overnight.
