The following morning Jorsda gives us baked goods; including a chocolate cake named 'Barrelbands.' Jaffrey stabled the mule, and we purchased rations and traveller's cloaks for the cold weather from Nathaniel.

We took off ahead of Cpt. Degas and by mid-day we made the cavern where we were captured. By late evening we made the guard tower. We waited to see if there was a patrol and then charged the tower concealed by dusk and heavy rain. We easily broke through the damaged entry door and fought our way to the top of the tower. There we found three hobgoblins around a planning table. We found a map of the area and rescued a man tortured on the balcony. Below we could see Degas' men fighting a goblin patrol we had avoided.

Downstairs, we searched the locked closet which contained a hidden switch revealing a passage to the basement. Degas' men arrived and prevent us from searching further. Afterwards, we treated and questioned the tortured commoner, named Sildar Hallwinter. He's originally from Durac and was hired to watch a caravan from Ft. Felix headed to Phandalin. Sildar was a member of Felix's task force "Flying Eagles." The caravan belonged to Gundrand Rockseeker who was also captured but taken elsewhere. Rockseeker thinks they have found the entrance to Wave Echo Cave, home of Phandelver's Pact which was to protect the magical forge. Rockseeker has a map and references in ancient texts to help find the cave. Sildar is also looking for his friend Iarno Albrek, a wizard.
