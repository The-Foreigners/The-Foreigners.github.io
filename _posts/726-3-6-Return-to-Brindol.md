We make Brindol in the late afternoon the next day. They soldiers are building defenses and many businesses are boarded up. Bilfor, had run Bilfor's Barrels and Baubles. Atticus asks Bilfor for payment for guarding his caravan, he gives us two platinum. We're approached by a captain who asks us who we are and trys to get us to leave with the evacuation. Zera trys to uses his noblility to gain an audience, but the two nobles hate each other and it doesn't work. We're told the general won't see us. We then ask for the Captain Olverth, who we met previously, and are told he's the Night Marshal now.
