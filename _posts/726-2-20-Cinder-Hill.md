We head a ways up the trail towards Cinder Hill. We ambush five orcs riding boars, taking Sgt. Ugis prisoner. He tells us he's under command of Scather who's under Wyrmlord Stormcaller. He also tells us that the army consists of 3400 orc, 150 monsters, 50 undead along with various commanders and officers. He says they were on their way to relieve the bridge. When we tell him of its destruction he says we've only delayed them by two days. He asks if "do we have wyvern riders too?". He tells us that the army will arrive tomorrow, and that a day east of the bridge is a shallow crossing to bypass the bridge. I sent a message to an emissary of General Felix telling him of the size of the army and that we've sent giants to aid Brindol.

We fight another patrol with 3 barghasts and some more reinforcements. We retreat towards the bridge, lead off the trail and hide our tracks, then head north along the river. The next day we continued along the river. Within the woods we came across five giant spiders and four edicaps. That night we make the grasslands and camp along the river. We are approached by a band of tieflings riding scorpions. They tell us that our friends are across the lake and fens on the Witch trail. They tell us that there is a roadblock two days ahead on the North Road, and that there's another roadblock on the Witch trail. They have seen a black dragon hunting the Black Fens. Rhestilor is seven days by road, and there is a swarm of razorfiends and a small dragonoid.

We take a day to make the road, then spend another day north on the road pushing to make an extra two hours. The next day we approach the road block invisibly. Once inside, there were two casters on the roof that hit us hard with a few spells through a trapdoor. During the battle a horn blew for backup, four boar riders approached, one a caster. Firing from the roof, we kill the cast and two others before they arrive. The last died busting through the door into a trap and webs. We can see a buzzard circling from the way they came.

Searching the building we find fine trade goods, gems, a few coins, and two barrels of foul liquid that is very flammable. Find a platinum medallion of tiamat around the caster's neck, 14 pearls (100g ea.), 25g 150s 237c. Set building aflame, and went west to investigate. There were three corpses around a cart, a tiefling at the reigns. In a secret compartment, we find two 100g diamonds, a case of green potions. We dump a barrel of greenwave they were smuggling, and it spawns 18 twig creatures.

We're three days till the swamp, five days through the swamp to Rhestilor. We continue onwards, and towards dusk we come across four chuuls. Grin harvests a vial of Chuul poison. That night, I sent a message to Cpt. Serena telling her that the army will arrive tomorrow. She says the ferry is scuttled after seeing orc scouts.
