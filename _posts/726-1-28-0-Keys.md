We finish our exploration of Wave Echo Cave, the cavern ocean remains to be explored.

Searching amongst the goblins corpses outside of the cave, we find some goblins with sharpened teeth under the 'whip' banner. The goblins seem to be fighting amongst themselves.

We return to Phandalin, after weathering a magical storm. We check in the Sildar. He says Thanye sent funds to secure the cave entrance to the manor. Halia is gone and will face guild justice, she's been replaced with Aiden the new moneychanger. Sildar tells of rumors about Orlane: people being altered, changlings can be identified by bite marks on the neck.

We continue on to Me'uiedre and arrive on the 26th. Edgar the blacksmith tells us that his daughter is talking of adventuring, maybe heading south to fight the orcs. Katyrn says she will encourage Olyans to enter the army. Thayne left a message with Sothas: tells Atticus that Thayne has left word for him in Keys, that we should go to the inn and ask for him by name. We should travel from Keys to Kuldara then into the Elysr Vale and meet in Brindol, it should take eights days of travel.

We travel two days to Keys, the woods turn from unruly to cultivated. We enter a large town, where two roads come together. We arrive at the Sleeping Lion Inn around the evening. We ask for Thayne and a portly gentleman tells us that a rider was supposed to deliver a message, but he has never returned from Orlane and has been gone for eight days. He tells us that no merchants are headed to Orlane, and no one has come from there. Another rider was sent to scout the town, and he should return late tomorrow.
