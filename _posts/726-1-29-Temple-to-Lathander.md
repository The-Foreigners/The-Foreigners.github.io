title: Temple to Lathander
---
The next morning we carefully approached to outskirts of town. As we enter Orlane, we circle around to the east to the temple. Within, we see a door with a bloody hand print. Inside we find an injured woman in chainmail, named Misha. She said, "They killed them all", that half the town killed the other half and left. She tells us that the changing started about a year ago, but the attack was five to ten days ago. She says that Rector Abramo was one of the leaders and that she didn't see it until it was too late, and that he left with the assailants. She says her holy emblem was stolen by looters. Finally, she informs us that the Golden Grain is the third building on the right from the town square. 

We enter the Rector's chambers and find incoherent babble written about with mentions of "Snake Mother" and "A crocodile has many teeth." The room is a mix of neat and untidy. In a locked chest we find ripped clothing and fragments of ivory balled up in cloth; apparently a statue of Lathander which I grab to mend later. In the desk in a bottom drawer is a book of Lathander. We clear the other neighboring houses, in one Grin finds a greataxe named "Hew".

We head back towards the entrance road to fetch the mule, Eyrn, and we find a group of looters. We subdue one, George, who says that we should avoid the inn; that something is amiss. Also, that they were taking loot to the abandoned farmhouse to the west. We then proceeded to the farmhouse to secure the town's property.
