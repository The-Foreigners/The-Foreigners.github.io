The next morning we carefully approached to outskirts of town. As we enter Orlane, we circle around to the east to the temple. Within, we see a door with a bloody hand print. Inside we find an injured woman in chainmail, named Misha. She said, "They killed them all." Half the town killed the other half and left. Her holy emblem was stolen by looters. She says the changing started about a year ago, but the attack was five to ten days ago, and that Rector Ambro left with the survivors/assailants. She tells us that the Golden Grain is the third building on the right from the town square. She says that the Rector Abramo was one of the leaders and that she didn't see it until it was too late.

We enter the Rector's chambers and find incoherant babble written about with mentions of "Snake Mother" and "A crocodile has many teeth." The room is a mix of neat and untidy. In a locked chest we find ripped clothing and fragments of ivory balled up in cloth; apparently a statue of Lathander which I grab to mend later. In the desk in a bottom drawer is a book of Lathander. We clear the other neighboring houses, in one Grin finds a greataxe named "Hew".

We head back towards the entrance road to fetch the mule Eyrn and we find a group of looters. We subdue one, George, who says that we should avoid the inn, that something is amiss. Also, that they were taking loot to the abandoned farmhouse to the west. We head to the farmhouse to secure the town's property.
