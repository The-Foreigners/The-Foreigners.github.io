Arriving in Kuldera, Zera heads to the White Dove Inn to take a proper bath. Meanwhile, Grin lead us to Ralph's Music Shop to purchase a lute. We get a recommendation to visit Cary the metalsmith; her shop has a crossed hammer sign. She had a nice set of dwarven plate armor that she would fit over night. Atticus lead us to Isabelle's to find chain jewlery, to wear a signet ring. Leaving the shop, Ethor was gnawing on a blue/gold javelin. We then head the the tailor Aman, a flamboyant dragonborn, to get Atticus a new traveler's cloak.
