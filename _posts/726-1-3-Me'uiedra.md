We make the Duke's Road, travelling we came upon a corpse and a dead horse rittled with arrows lying in the road. Some distance away is an overturned cart with a goblin underneath. After some struggle, we flipped the cart revealing a hidey-hole. Zera guarded up top, while the rest descended to kill off remaining goblins.

We arrive in Me'uiedre as Olanays' father was coordinating a rescue party.
