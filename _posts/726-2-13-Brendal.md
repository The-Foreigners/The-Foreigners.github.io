title: Departing Kuldera
---
Leave Kuldera to the southwest. Entering a drier region that should be in full growing season, but plants are dry. Hear of rumors that beasts travel the road. First two nights we stay in inns. Zera tells us the his brother Lucien is the one mentioned by the rogue. Following two nights we make camp, then one more inn. Land in Brendal at the end of the sixth day, staying in the "Tired Giant" inn. Town has a population of about 8000, located next to a river, and surrounded by a wall.

We ask a town guard about Thanye, called a King's Man by the guard, and told to ask Cpt. Olverth, the captain of the guard. We're told Thayne took a patrol hunting for orcs northwest past Rhest, then down Old North Road a few days ago. He previously went south and found nothing. Guard says Vyrth Keep is haunted. We leave a message for Thayne saying "Wave Echo Cave secure, Orlane is lost, well head to Drelin's Ferry and Vryth Keep."

Traveling for a few days, the air get drier and drier and the towns get smaller and smaller. We passed many abandoned farms, and just outside of Drelin's Ferry we're ambushed about mid-day.
