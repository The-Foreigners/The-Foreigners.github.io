title: Wave Echo Cave, Continued
---
We continue to the rooms behind the chamber with Black Spider and find Nundro. He tells us that Black Spider killed his brother. Black Spider went room to room trying to get more information. We escort Nundro back to the entrance, and the brothers are happy to see each other. We convince the brothers to camouflage the cave entrance.

We return to our last point in the cavern and continue into a cavern with a ravine where it looks as if stream has been diverted into a cavern room with water to the ceiling. We find bugbears digging in a pile of rocks, the reason was not obvious.

We circle back to the entry, and work our way into a large hall filled with dwarf and orc skeletons. We fight four ghouls and four ghasts. We backtrack to the entry to rest for the evening and hear a lot of fighting across the valley.

The following dawn, we approach the battlefield. We see goblins 50 to 100 on either side fighting. There are two banners, a multicolored whip, and the Cragmaw. The Cragmaw fall, with the Whip losing a third of their number with 40-50 remaining. We then sneak our way back to the cavern.

Continuing down the right pathway we are attacked by stirges. We clear a few rooms and eventually make it to the furnace. There we find a flame skull and eight zombies.
