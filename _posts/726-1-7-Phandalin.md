Spend the night in the inn, while maintaining watch. Have breakfast in a hurry with Sildar then head to Barthin's provisions. We hear from Barthin that Quenell Alderleaf's son Carp has seen Redbrands near a cave in the wood outside their farm. A little bit North is a mining camp with Gundrand's brothers. We hear that the Miner's Exchange isn't getting any trouble from the Redbrands.  The Sleeping Giant Taphouse near the ruined manor is crawling with Redbrands. There is also a band of orcs harassing people off the Triboar Trail.

We head to the Townmaster Hall, and see a notice board offering a reward for the orcs on the Triboar Trail. Harbin Wester, the Townmaster, is unconcerned by the goblins that captured Sildar or the Redbrands, he's only concerned with the orcs.  This infuriates Sildar, whoh sticks around as we head to the Sleeping Giant Taphouse.

Walking up to the Taphouse, three guards get a bit fiesty when we say we have a package to deliever to Glasstaff. We subdue the guards and they say Glasstaff is in the old manor; entrance in the cellar. We quickly head over to the manor and enter the cellar. The cellar contains crates with a wizard emblem and a cistern with a rope anchored underneight the water heading down. Grin enters a door under the stairs then falls in a trap. The hall leads to a crypt with four tombs surrounded by skeletons in rusted mail. We find a secret door to a cavern with a crevasse and passages in the distance. An armory is off the hallway, and another room contains slaver cells with two women and a child. We free them, Mirna Dendrar, tells us of an heirloom on a shelf in a shope on the Southeastern side of Thundertree, an abandoned ghost town, as a reward. She also tells us to be careful of the wizard and his furry friends, and asks us to look for her husband Thel who was also captured.

We escorted the freed prisoners out of the cellar dressed in Redbrand cloaks. Near the cellar entrance Zera checks a door and finds Redbrands. We take a prisoner and lock him in a cell. The Redbrand prisoner tells us to take the right bridge, the right hallway, through the right door. With further questioning, we learn there is a secret backdoor in the storeroom before the crevasse. He warns us of the eye monster in the cravasse and says that the "Black Spider" hired the Redbrands to scare off adventurers and intimidate the locals. Says they aren't working with the orcs in the North.

We take a short rest in the first room where we found the Redbrands.
