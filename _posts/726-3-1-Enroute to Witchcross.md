title: Enroute to Witchcross
--- 
Grabbed a orc warhorn that Zera can use with Thamaturgy as a distraction. We're more than a day away from Witchcross. We bound the orc prisoner's hands and sent him north. Head south towards Witchcross. In the distance we see two splint armored orc, seven regular orcs, and a hellhound. On them we find a crude map of the area marked with farmhouses and some simple raided loot. We ride into the night, try holding up in an abandoned farmhouse. Hear war whoops and fight orcs and four barghasts. Spend the night, during watch we were attacked by three mantacores.
