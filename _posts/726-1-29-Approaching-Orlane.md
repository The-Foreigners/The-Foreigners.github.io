Before we set out we get the descriptions of the riders. The first rider, Corey, is a young blond. The second rider, Bruwin, is a dwarf. Both should be on horseback. We then find Christof's Curiosities and purchase a 'hearing' horn in the hopes of using it for 'Clairvoyance' of the Golden Grain Inn.

On our way to Orlane we run across two brigands that had set up an ambush along the road. We find their camp and loot 220g, a case of nine Tor Vineyards Special Collection (100g ea) ~30 y.o. wine, a potion of superior healing, a potion of heroism, and a scroll of cone of cold.

We meet Bruwin on the road carrying Corey across his saddle. He reports there are piles of dead bodies with stabbing and clubbing wounds which have been dead a week or two. There are looters remaining in the town. Bruwin says the town is cursed.

We take a short rest then continue until night. During camp we are attacked by two Air Elementals; of which Ethor gets his first kill. The next morning we carefully approached to outskirts of town.
