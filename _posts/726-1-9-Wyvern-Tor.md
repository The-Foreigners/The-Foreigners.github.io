In the morning, we meet Cpt. Degas downstairs in the inn. We tell him about Azarr'kul and the orcs in the south. Sildar shows up and tells us he captured Redbrands at the Miner's Exchange and that a missive has been sent to the guild to hopefully find a replacement for Holia and that a response will allow him to arrest her. Inform Sildar about the orcs at Wyvern Tor, he says we need to go to the Townmaster's Hall. He then introduces Morrin, his new apprentice. Sildar then asks that we return his affects (a sword with a flying eagle) if they turn up. We try to interrogate the goblin, but he doesn't answer.
