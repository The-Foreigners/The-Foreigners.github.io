We awake, and after some compelling begin our questioning of our prisoner within a Zone of Truth (an answer after a failed save will be italicized):

**How many doppelgangers?** It's hard to count.

**Once you had the dwarf and map where were you to go?** *Thundertree, I have a cabin there.*

**Where is Black Spider?** Wave Echo Cave

**Why does he need a map?** He doesn't.

**Why does Black Spider want the map?** To burn it.

**How did Black Spider find the cave?** He followed the dwarves.

**Whose form were you in (when we arrived)?** Just someone I've seen...I have plenty (proceeds to change shape)

**What does Black Spider want magical weapons for?** Combat.

**Who are the enemies of Black Spider?** The humans, the dwarves.

**Is he just working with other drow?** *No.*

**Humans, dwarves, orcs?** Eventually he'll make it to the orcs...has no relation with the orcs.

**Who is Black Spider doing business with?** Black Spider

**What should we expect when we get to Wave Echo Cave?** Lots of unpleasantness, fight whatever took up residence there...the undead.

**How much do you get paid?** Not enough.

**Are the dwarf brothers alive?** *When I left.*

**Do you have any loyalty to Black Spider beyond payment?** No.

**What if someone offered you more payment?** I'd be willing to negotiate.

**How is Black Spider able to finance?** I don't know, same as you.

**(What would you do) if we let you go without stipulation?** Figure out which side wins...maybe go pretend to be a noble.

**How open are you to contracting in the future?** Always interested in money.

**How can we contact you?** *I'll be in Thundertree for a few days.*

**Is there a time limit?** Black Spider is exploring the cave, we should hurry.

**How long does it take to get there?** About a day.

**Do you plan on killing us if we let you go?** Not if I don't have to, but there are any number of reasons to...attack me again.


We return to Phandalin with Gundrand and Vyerith. Head to Townmaster hall and Sildar to have Vyerith imprisoned. Inform Sildar that King Grol is dead, and return him is armor and weapons. When I asked for a letter of introduction to Gen. Felix Sildar branded Grin with a Flying Eagle scar. We should show the scar to Sothas, the booze-ooze in the inn, and he'll direct us from there. However, we only have four days til Gen. Felix passes through Me'uiedra on the 16th.

We do some general housekeeping business. We also register the manor in our name, it will take 75 days and 13,000g to rebuild.

We try to convince Gundrand to stay and await our return, but he refuses. We do convince him to go and scout out the cave and wait for us there, and we offer to provision him. He tells us that to get to Wave Echo Cave, travel east from Phandalin to the Duke's Defenses. We will cross over a mountain with a lake, from there head north over two mountains. In the final valley there is a cavern to the east.
