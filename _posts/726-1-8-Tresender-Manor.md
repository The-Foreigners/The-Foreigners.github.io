We awake in our defensive position, and find Sildar out in the hall. He says a large contingent of soldiers arrived last night looking for us. Our reinforcements arrived! Sildar wants us to find Cragmaw Castle, goblins there have ties to the hobgoblins downstairs. Need to ask them questions, still need to find Black Spider.

We must head to Wyvern Tor, so we restock at Barthin's. Proceed to Miner's Exchange, where Holia trades us for coinage and reagents. We check-in with Cpt. Dega at the inn, he'll send a letter to have Sildar appointed as Reeve. He says orcs rarely make it this far north through the domain. As we leave the inn we spot a red cloak dashing behind the corner. We give chase but lose him in the crowd near Mirna's. We barge in to her house, but no red cloak. She says she is heading to Kuldera with the troops then on to her cousins in Drellin's Mill. 

Walking out we see the red cloak round the neighboring building, the Miner's Exchange. Thayne and Zera enter and Grin and I watch the back. Holia was adamant that the Redbrands aren't a problem. We tell Sildar and he grabs two soliders and head back to the Miner's Exchange to deal with them.

We head up the Triboar Trail and come to a cave with a single orc at the entrance. Grin speaks with him, and he soon introduces himself as Bruglor Axebiter of the Many Arrows tribe. He says war is coming and that he needs to reprovision before heading north where he is seeking asylum, that's why his tribe has been raiding the local area. Orc tribes are being united under the Tribe of the Red Hand by force. They will eventually move north and slaughter and subjugate the humans like they did his tribe. Says that the southern border is weak and poorly defended and that General Felix will be no match for Azarr'kul the Khan who has subjugated, married, or killed off other orc tribes. He will conquer kingdom after kingdom.

Bruglor needs more food and arrows for the trip over the mountain, trying to get to the northern giants who may stop Azarr'kul. We strike a bargain, Bruglor will stop raiding and we will use the bounty on their heads to buy them provisions. Bruglor gives Grin a bracelet, the symbol of his tribe, to show that we ran them off and a sending stone. We need provisions for six orcs and an ogre for ten days and 100 arrows.

We make it back to town late. Thayne goes out 'fishing' and returns later with a goblin that he smuggles back into our rooms.
