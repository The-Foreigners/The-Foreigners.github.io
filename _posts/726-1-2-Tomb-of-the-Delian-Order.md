title: Tomb of the Delian Order
---
Followed old goblin tracks south. Prepared the dwarf corpse for burial then rested for the night. Continued following tracks south the following day. Found a drag path leading towards a cove with a stone door guarded by two goblins. Circled behind to ambush the goblin guards. The door inscription read, "Here lies the greatest knights of the realm." Overheard goblins complaining about having to pay boss with gear. We believed the tomb was being robbed and successfully ambushed the guards.

We entered the tomb and discovered a group of goblins around a brazier. We kill two and get two to submit. Goblin captive says that they claim the tomb as theirs. Sent one goblin to tell boss that the tomb is ours. Then a patrol of goblins atop full grown worgs return. After a hard fought fight Grin; in his rage, brained the other captive. Mural depicts eight knights decimating goblins in war. Investigating, we discover that the goblin's teeth are filed to points. We also recover Thayne and Grin's backpacks from the patrol. Read inscription on the wall, "I vow to defend and protect the weak, defeat chaos in all its forms, and uphold justice by being fair to all."

Round the corner and discover a bugbear and a goblin shaman performing a ritual sacrifice of a girl. After defeating the bugbear and shaman, Grin breaks girl free from the cage. She's named Olanays and she's from Me'uiedre, a town to the south, where she is the blacksmith's daughter. Under the statue, an inscription, "If you are to keep this you must first give it to me." along with the name, Sextus Varius.

Looks as if the room wasn't desecrated. Put the stone axe in statue's hand, which then strikes the corpses of the goblin and bugbear. Repeating the vow aloud unlocked a secret door. The crypt contained six smaller tombs and a large tomb engraved with a person wielding a sword and shield. Thayne awakens six skeletons along with Sextus Varius. After some dialouge, Thayne says vow and is dubbed with Sextus' sword and awarded a small pouch. While reinterring bodies a Goblin Bane warhammer appears.

We then continue south through the evening, and setup camp off the road. Had an uneventful watch with only a few scratches in the night.
