title: Onward Towards Kuldera
---
We make camp on the trail a day out from Keys. Grin is attacked by the forest on his watch. Zera was knocked unconscious, and was stabilized by Ethor. Misha joined the fight with 'spirit guardians'. Afterwards, Zera is slightly upset with Grin, and Atticus hides 'Hew' in the woods.

We continue on to the earlier ambush site. We opened the case of ordinary wine we had left behind and setup camp. Misha says she will stay in Keys awhile, is thinking of going to Me'uiedra or Homlett or across the realm to Durac. I tell her that there's more to a temple than the building, and that she is still responsible for the faithful. We encourage her to consider staying in Keys to research the Serpent Queen, to hire adventures to find the Temple, and do a background investigation of Garath Primo. We will fund her stay with the wealth of Orlane. She says she is waiting for direction from higher and that they are just as likely to cover it up as resolve the problem. In the meantime, Grin trains Ethor 'fetch',  he can now retrieve items that you throw.

I spend the night drinking, and end up sleeping in the cart during the next days travel. We decide to continue on through Keys to Kuldera after stocking up on rations and alchemy supplies. The road was fairly quiet expect for a gnoll and a handful of hyenas. On the morning of the seventh, we arrive in Kuldera.
