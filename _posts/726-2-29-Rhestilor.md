The next day we boarded two boats and headed east, we approached Rhestilor stealthily between the lizardfolk huts. Observing the area: there is a bell tower, a town hall one story and a roof tap above the water; there are walkways between the buildings; the entire area is surrounded by camps of lizardfolk. We cast waterwalk and invisibility and stealthily attacked the bell tower using silence on the bell. The armorer had a key around his neck, the cleric had an amulet of Tiamat, and there was 25c on the table. In the chest under the bed, four bags of 25g each, two potions of flying (Grin and I take one).

We headed towards the next building. There were four ogres on the rooftop, two on the boardwalk walking the perimeter. Atticus' spectre went through the wall, raising the alarm. Eventually, a dragon and rider emerged from the water blasting us. We fought the six orges on our way into the building. The fight continued until the dragon attempted to rise through a hole in the floor. The dragon was knocked prone and both it and the rider fell into the water only to be blasted to death by a well placed fireball. Some more minions came up the stairs which we easily dispatched.
