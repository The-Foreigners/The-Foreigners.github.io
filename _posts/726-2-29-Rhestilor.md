The next day we board two boats and head east, we approach Rhestilor stealthily by the lizardfolk huts. There is a bell tower, a town hall one story and a roof tap above the water. There are walkways between the buildings. The entire area is surrounded by camps of lizardfolk. We a cast waterwalk and invisibility and steathily attack the bell tower. The armorer had a key around his neck, the cleric had an amulet of tiamat, and there was 25c on the table. In the chest under the bed, four bags of 25g ea., two potions of flying (Grin and I take one).

Headed towards the next building, there are four ogres on the rooftop, two on the boardwalk walking the perimeter. Atticus' spectre went through the walk, raising the alarm. Eventually, a dragon and rider emerged from the water blasting us. We fight the six orges on our way into the building. The fight continues until the dragon attempts to rise through a hole in the floor. The dragon is knocked prone and both it and the rider fall into the water to be blasted to death by a well placed fireball. Some more minions come up the stairs which we easily dispatch.
