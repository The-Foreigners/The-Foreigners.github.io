title: Thayne's Departure
---
After a night at the manor and a couple days on the road we arrive at Me'uiedra in the late afternoon. We purchase provisions and then spend the evening at the tavern. Thanye meets a few of the Realm's guard: Brice, a forest elf; Breann, a human; and Angus, a human, where he instigates a brawl between Angus and Grin. We all head out back; and with Sothas refereeing, Grin trounces Angus. Afterwards, Grin showed Sothas the brand. He asked if we knew of Iarno. He seemed a bit concerned, until Grin explained that Sildar gave him the brand and that we defeated Iarno. Sothas removes the magically removes the brand, and says we need to talk to Felix's man. He leads us through the casino to a door in the back then down a stairway where we enter a room with a black cloaked figure with a steel mask at a desk covered in maps.
