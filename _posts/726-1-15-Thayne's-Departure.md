title: Thayne's Departure
---
After a night at the manor and a couple days on the road we arrive at Me'uiedra in the late afternoon. We purchase provisions and then spend the evening at the tavern. Thanye meets a few of the Realm's guard: Brice, a forest elf; Breann, a human; and Angus, a human, where he instigates a brawl between Angus and Grin. We all head out back; and with Sothas refereeing, Grin trounces Angus. Afterwards, Grin showed Sothas the brand. He asked if we knew of Iarno. He seemed a bit concerned, until Grin explained that Sildar gave him the brand and that we defeated Iarno. Sothas removes the magically removes the brand, and says we need to talk to Felix's man. He leads us through the casino to a door in the back then down a stairway where we enter a room with a black cloaked figure with a steel mask at a desk covered in maps.

Sorren:

Please know that I did not make the decision to leave lightly. How does one choose between riding to almost certain death in order to stem the impending invasion to the south, or to secure a magical forge to properly equip the realm’s army to halt the approaching emerald deluge? In the end, I simply had to ask myself where I could make the most impactful difference against the rising tide. The ominous events of late seem to serve as some foul harbinger of the hungering chaos that seeks to consume our beloved kingdom. I have no doubt that our troupe will succeed at taking the forge, especially with you amongst their number. I cannot help but picture vividly in my mind our troupe being reunited in some glorious and grandiose battle, standing back to back on some field to the south, opposing the oncoming orc horde!

While I do not doubt that the day quickly approaches, I wanted to thank you (while I am able) for your gentleness and kindness during our adventures. It has truly been my honor to have been able to accompany you as we sought to make a tangible difference in our travels. Sadly, at present there is not one healing spell in the world that could cure this festering wound that eats away at my soul, as I lay here thinking about parting from our adventuring band.

I take great comfort in knowing that forces for good will vigilantly be working to frustrate those who seek to do great evil on at least TWO fronts, both at Wave Echo and in the Elsyr Vale. Until we meet again, dear friend.

Respectfully,

*Sir Thayne Solosian of the Deelian Order, Captain of the Realm, Esteemed Member of the Flying Eagles*
