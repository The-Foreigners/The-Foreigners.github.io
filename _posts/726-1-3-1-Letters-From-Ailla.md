Dearest Brother Sorren,

I hope your work is going well. Forgive me for not writing the last year but at first the baby consumed all of my time. Then after a few months I was so ashamed at not writing that I found I couldn't write, and the longer I went the more my shame grew until I didn't know what to do!

Aelric finally show my anguish and pressed me to write. He said he would not talk to me until I put quill to parchment! I'm so lucky to have him. I think he misses you was much as I do.

I hope your travels lead to something remarkable! I wish you had told us where you were going so I could come and visit. It's not so far that you can't come to us, is it? Come visit, please.

Ellie has been doing so well! I can't thank you enough for being there for us to help with her birth! Can you believe that she's almost one?! She is healthy, happy, and making a lovely mess of our home.

Orlane grows and prospers. The mayor, Zakarias Ormond, is wise and strong and we trade regularly with Hommlet and the seat of the barony at Kuldara. Aelric works as a cobbler and a whitesmith, buying supplies from Simon the owner of the local store, and fixing little things around town. I help where possible. I've made thimbles for all the ladies! That was fun. And now we know everyone! It was a simple thing, but helped make us feel like part of the town.

Farmer Hewitt invites us to dinner at least once a week and we always accept. He has such a lovely family. I envy him. His eldest girl, Cirili, looks up to me, I think. She's been helping me a great deal with Ellie and around the house. She has no taste for farming so we hired her as a nanny. I have also started to teach her sewing and whitesmithing. She is a fast learner.

The constable is a man named Grover. He's a hard and suspicious man who orginally tried to talk Aelric and I into returning to my father's farm, but once we made it clear we were staying, he came around. He is not welcoming, but he treats everyone the same, which is a kind of fairness I suppose.

There is a temple to Lathander here. It makes me sad to see that beautiful place standing ruined. Many of the people remember when it was the source of the town's fortune and health. But we have not seen a priest of Lathander in a long time, and it has fallen into disuse.

The town has two inns! Not even Hommlet, which everyone says is the better of the two towns, has two inns! The Golden Grain is the larger and more popular, but Aelric and I do not go there because the men who frequent the place are base and crude.

Instead we frequent the Slumbering Serpent which is smaller, but very nice. Ollwin the innkeep and his wife Belba were the first to welcome Aelric and I and made us feel at home. They are good people, I hope their inn prospers.

The people here are welcoming and hardworking. We are lucky to live here. But Aelric want more, he is not satisfied mending shoes and pots and pans.

Dearest Brother Sorren,

Good news! Kennoc, the town's blacksmith left Orlane to work as a smith in Kuldara, which means Aelric is now our town's blacksmith! I'm so proud of him!

It's so much work. I'm up every hour the gods send helping him with the smithy. He's such a proud man, he refuses to hire an apprentice and so pressed me into service. I don't mind, I find the work very rewarding, and being with him in his work, sharing in it, brings me great happiness. I see him now, as the work piles up, thinking about bringing someone else one, and I confess I redouble my efforts. I'm jealous of an apprentice he hasn't even hired yet! I'm such a fool.

I fair think I could do the work myself, were I so inclined. Blacksmithing isn't that hard. After all, men do it and most of them don't have the sense the gods gave a goose.

Cirili helps me greatly and spends almost as much time helping raise Ellie and working around the smithy as she does on the farm. She loves her family, I can tell, but dreads the life of a farmer. We're lucky to have her as a friend.

Husband was eager for me to tell you the news. He admires you terribly. It would mean the world to him if you could write.

Dearest Sorren,

The temple of Lathander is open! A nice young man, Rector Abramo, moved in. He showed me around and encouraged me to return. I asked him if he was overwhelmed with the task set out before him and he smiled. "Yes," he said. "But Lathander's power will allow me to rebuild this church as a symbol of his powers of rebirth."

I thought that very wise. Our rector is a good man. The temple is still a ruin, it will take years of work to restore it, it is made of stone after all, but there is always a light in there now and it makes my heart glad to know someone is there, performing the rituals.

All blessings to Lathander, the Morninglord. May his dawn shine upon our hearts.

Sorren,

I had the strangest thing happen to me today, and my first thoughts were of you.

I went to Tristram the carpenter's shop and he did not recognize me! I've seen the man every day for the past year and it took him fully three bells to remember me and even then his speech was slow.

I have heard rumors of strange goings on in the town, but dismissed them as a fancy. I see houses and farms I knew, now standing empty. The constable says people are leaving for Hommlet, and at first I accepted this. Hommlet is larger and more prosperous.

But why should anyone leave Orlane? It is a paradise. I wish I knew our Lord Mayor better and could ask him. But his constable seems sure of what's going on, so probably my concerns are misplaced.

Still, very strange looking into Tristram's eyes and not seeing any sign of recognition there.

Please write back!

Sorren,

More strange tidings, though I suspect it's my imagination at work more than anything else.
