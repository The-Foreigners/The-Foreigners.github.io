> Dearest Brother Sorren,

> I hope your work is going well. Forgive me for not writing the last year but at first the baby consumed all of my time. Then after a few months I was so ashamed at not writing that I found I couldn't write, and the longer I went the more my shame grew until I didn't know what to do!


Dearest Brother Sorren,

Good news! Kennoc, the town's blacksmith left Orlane to work as a smith in Kuldara, which means Aelric is now our town's blacksmith! I'm so proud of him!
