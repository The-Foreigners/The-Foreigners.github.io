title: Return to Wyvern Tor
---
In the morning, we meet Cpt. Degas downstairs in the inn. We tell him about Azarr'kul and the orcs in the south. Sildar shows up and tells us he captured Redbrands at the Miner's Exchange and that a missive has been sent to the guild to hopefully find a replacement for Holia and that a response will allow him to arrest her. Inform Sildar about the orcs at Wyvern Tor, he says we need to go to the Townmaster's Hall. He then introduces Morrin, his new apprentice. Sildar then asks that we return his effects (a sword with a flying eagle) if they turn up. We try to interrogate the goblin, but he doesn't answer.

Purchase a mule, 80 rations, 50 arrows, barrel of ale, and an empty barrel. We close out our bill for room and board at the inn. Towards early afternoon, we head to Townmaster Hall and talk with Sildar; we receive our 100g reward. Sildar doesn't like the news about Azarr'kul, says we should head south with Gen. Felix. Sildar may need us to deliver a message when we come back through headed to Mu'euidra. He also says that someone will need to take possession of the manor eventually, but it will remain unoccupied and closed off until we can clear it.

We head north and make Wyvern Tor by late evening. Reaching the cave entrance, Bruglor greets us. Inside there  are several injured orcs and several children. He has a few more orcs than he originally let on. Grin asks about her Sharp tribe; Bruglor says they have joined the Red Hand and they are now generals and captains. Bruglor says he knows of Nyatte Toothsharp, a Red Hand general. He says when they join the group they take a new name.

Bruglor helps interrogate the goblin which we brought packed in a barrel. We learn that to get to the castle theres a trail west of Phandalin that heads west then northwest through a valley to the castle. Also, King Grol leads the Cragmaw who told the goblins to capture a dwarf which they recently accomplished.

In the rear of the cavern several orcs were trying to solve a puzzle to a vault. Detect magic reveals 69 different magical source all overlapping. Pushing 'S' in 'curse' reveals a lock which Zera picks. Door opens to a room containing a platinum unicorn statue (500g), dragon tapestry (400g), and a chest with 300g. Zera recognizes Mealton the Great in the tapestry who took over the lands 1000 years ago and the dragon was a blight until he slew it. The tapestry belongs to artwork that was commissioned to honor him.

We gave 200g to Blugor, he says we should keep the sending stone to call him if we needed. If we meet any orce fleeing the south, we can use the sending stone and Bruglor will tell us where they can meet up. We leave a note and a copper behind then shut the vault door. I have a drinking contest with an orc, which I gloriously win. We stay the night in the cave.
