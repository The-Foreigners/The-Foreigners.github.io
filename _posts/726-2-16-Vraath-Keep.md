We proceed down the trail, come across a pile of leaves beside the road that attack us. We eventually make the road and reach the Keep by mid-day. We stay back some distance to observe. There was a moss covered footpath leading to the Keep with a broken tower. Evidence of humanoids and large boar. We climb the hillside and spiderclimb the tower where I'm spotted by a Minotaur. I grab its horns through the window and jump to the ground to fight. We're spotted and I climb back up. Inside a glowing room a human is lashed to a frame. Wyrmlord Koth calls up the stairs for us to give up. We learn that south of here there is a Lich that resurrects creatures. Zera sneaks down the outside of the wall and fireballs the lower room. The fight continues to the courtyard where we capture Koth, loot 9 jade (100g ea.), 8p 216g 251s, gold necklace 250g, silk cloak with silver and gold 250g, and a piece of paper...battle plans.

We find a trap door leading 40ft down to a vault with three chambers. One with a large trunk, one with small iron coffers, and one with a desk with books and papers. There is a skeleton holding a large great axe with a magic aura. The chest also had a magic aura. Inside the coffers: 250g 250s, 500s, 250g 1750s, a 500g diamond. In the desk chamber we find a the history of the keep with the last entry from Avery Vraath about the final battle with forest giants. The large chest has a large skull of a black dragon, 12 forest giant teeth, silver mithral +1 armor, a white oak with unicorn staff of life.

Before we return, we take down the corpse. Jor identifies him as Aruin, a local farmer. We start back to Drellin's Ferry, but camp the night the return trip will take most of a day. Send message to Thayne, he responds "Avoid North Road, look for Thayne's solider in Drellin's Ferry."  On road back, come across two hulking figures, Trolls. When we return to Drellin's Ferry, we take Koth to the cells in the Tollhouse.

A dark haired woman, Thayanee, Lion of Brendal, says that Thayne needs help clearing roadblocks along North Road and that the North Road and West trail are shut down completely. We are told that Skull Gorge Bridge a key piece of road for commerce to the West and that we need to know the numbers on Cinder Hill.

Interrgating Koth, we learn that there are more than orcs under  Azarr Kul's command, many great beasts: mantacores, inators, giants, trolls. The Ghostlord provides allies. Chymeras, dragons from the sky. A green dragon, Azuradian, is the power of the Dragon Queen behind Azarr Kul. He has several Wyrmlords. Azaar will not lead initial charge, that will be lead by Wyrmlord Kharn. Azarr in Temple of Tiamat. He doesn't know any more about the Lich, was once a proud druid; built a lion of stone. Took Wyrmlord from (?) Ulwai Stormcaller, she's a Wrymlord bard; doesn't know where she is. Nyett Toothsharp is a commander, works with hoard. They are on day three of the invasion plan. We must destroy the bridge, it will delay them many days.

We head to a meeting with the town council to discuss strategy, emphasizing that we should tell small towns to flee and destroy any war material they may leave behind.
