_Don't Eat This Book_
*Written by Naomi Persnipperance, to prevent further mistakes amongst her tribe.*
As the title would suggest, this book is all about surviving in the wild. Which herbs to eat, what mushroom to pluck, and what you can do to help people turned to stone by basilisks. Has a handy cheat sheet where you can look up if the stuff you just ate is going to kill you or not.

_Will This Kill Me?_
*Written by the rather odd goblin Iggy Stiggums, date/location of scripture unknown.*
A rare book about the alchemy of poisons, and a study of poison in the wild. In the back there is a short section about his personal life, and how he endured the many stings and bites he has received.
