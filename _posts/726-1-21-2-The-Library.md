__The Rise and Fall of Rhestilor__
This book outlines the rise and fall of the duchy of Rhestilor.

__How to make Illusions and Charm People__

__Don't Eat This Book__
*Written by Naomi Persnipperance, to prevent further mistakes amongst her tribe.*
As the title would suggest, this book is all about surviving in the wild. Which herbs to eat, what mushroom to pluck, and what you can do to help people turned to stone by basilisks. Has a handy cheat sheet where you can look up if the stuff you just ate is going to kill you or not.

__Will This Kill Me?__
*Written by the rather odd goblin Iggy Stiggums, date/location of scripture unknown.*
A rare book about the alchemy of poisons, and a study of poison in the wild. In the back there is a short section about his personal life, and how he endured the many stings and bites he has received.

__Why Do My Eyes Burn__
*Written by James Idrun, who studied the 'Vuxolia' tribe.*
A book describing the strange ongoings in an even stranger tribe. They worship the sun. Are often found raising their arms in the middle of work and shouting 'PRAISE' while staring into the sun. Many of them have gone blind.

__Diary of a Wimpy Kobold__

__This Is A Rock__
*Written by Grimmar Stonebasher, a dwarven mining expert in the Sunspire region.*
This book contains an immense amount of knowledge about minerals, gems and crystals. It describes how to properly identify them based on geometry and size, and sometimes taste. usually comes with a small sample embedded into the cover, but cheaper versions simply have a colored piece of paper to replace this.

__The Beastmaster__
*Written by an unknown author.*
The details of the author remain unknown, and not many copies of this book exist. It describes the act of taming wild animals, and which animals are actually safe to tame. Rumors speak of imbued properties in this book, that whoever reads them will be able to speak to animals. [These rumors are false, for this version]

__Speak Infernal In Ten Days__
*Written by Asmodeus Osatiel, who was an ambassador between humans and a series of devils.*
Sloppily written and difficult to understand, this book attempts to teach the reader the basics of Infernal. The useability of this book is long disputed, with many saying it is worth less then the paper it was written on, while others speak religiously of it's content. Many often blame this on the idea that Asmodeus was in fact a devil himself.

__Orcs And Diplomacy__
*Written by the late William Wildrider, in service of the king's request.*
William was ordered by his king to handle negotiations between the kingdom and an orc clan. The book details his experiences in setting up a peaceful agreement between both parties. Not long after finishing this book, war broke out between the two and this book was near-instantly discarded.

__Memoirs of a Genasi__

__A Sledge Too Far__
This details how the Dwarves of the Empire of Oranis delved too far, pierced the Under Dark, accidentally starting a war with the Drow that quickly overran them.

__The Dwarf That Had A Long Hard Pickaxe__
*Author requested to stay anonymous*
Most dwarfs often consider this the finest in romantic novels made. Other races tend to disagree, the descriptions are very vivid and detailed. Not recommended for the younger public.

__Should You Become A Powerful Wizard: A Guide To Wizardry__
*Written by Magnus Coldstone, for his pupils at the academy*
This book tells of the requirements to become a true wizard; from wands to spellbooks to the iconic pointy hat. Also details possible complications that may arise from being a wizard - like sudden incineration or death by giant monster.

__Grandma's Recipies__
*Written by Saffron Grasskeeper*
As age takes most of us, the need to write down important details becomes imperative. It is to this end, that Saffron wrote a large collection of medicinal salves and healing artifacts for her grandma. In the end the book was cut short due to her grandma dying from a fatal sword to the chest, but this book is still considered prized for it's healing recipies.

__A Handmaid's Tail: a collection of short stories by notable Tieflings__

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. I: Wards, Shields, and Protections__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Volume I of the series consists of a detailed explication of all manner of protective magics that involve fire. The pages detail both protections against fire magic as well as those that employ fire in their effect. The author opines that any dedicated student would be wise to master wards against fire before including any offensive tools in their arsenal. Readers of the text often report that their defensive capabilities against fire are improved after careful study of the text.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. II: Sprays, Rays, and Blasts__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Volume II of the series describes a wide array of magical formulae for using fire as an offensive tool. The applications are broadly theoretically and have been praised for their ability to be understood across a wide variety of magical disciplines. The general principles laid out in the text provide an excellent template for the development of new offensive magic. Although a wonderful primer for others, Serrowen's lack of personal combat experience can sometimes be evident. His proposal for a "sun burst" spell, requiring a minimum of one hour of concentration to cast, was especially panned by contemporary critics.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. III: Natural Fire Creatures, Their Habits and Uses__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Serrowen provides a comprehensive overview of all known natural creatures that use, consume, or otherwise live alongside fire as part of their regular existence. A generous grant from a group of druids interested in cataloguing and protecting these creatures enabled the sage to hire an elite group of rangers to explore and document animals across the known world. Praised as one of the finest texts of its kind, it still provides invaluable information about the creatures within its pages.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. IV: Supernatural Fire Creatures, The Magical and Elemental__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Against the advice and better judgement of his peers, Serrowen went to great pains to contact an efreet noble from the City of Brass. Extensive transcription of his interviews with that noble were transformed into the contents of the fourth and fifth volumes. It is largely unknown what Serrowen used to bargain with (or perhaps even compel) the noble to share the information in the text. Many more learned scholars have chosen to disregard both volumes for fear that they might contain incomplete, or even misleading, information. It is unknown whether those fears have any real foundation, as no one has undertaken any comprehensive fact-checking of the work.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. V: The Elemental Plane of Fire, Its Geography and Environs__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Although tainted by the questionable interviews that plagued his fourth volume, Serrowen's geography of the plane of fire enjoys a slightly better reputation. His insistence on hiring a well respected court painter to record scrying of various features of the plane provide a vivid and colorful impression. Although the specifics of his descriptions are sometimes disputed, conensus tends to suggest that the text and accompanying images are a reasonably accurate presentation of the plane.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. VI: "Gods" of Fire and their Servants__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
An unfortunate low point in an otherwise excellent collection. Serrowen was vehemently opposed to any worship of gods claiming dominion over fire. The first few chapters provide a cursory overview of deities with a portfolio that includes fire. He then proceeds to spend much of the remainder of the text elucidating several arguments as to the "true" nature of fire and its independence from any divine control. It is unknown why Serrowen argued so passionately against fire gods in this text. Several late contemporaries have suggested that he may not have been the actual author. In a nod to prudence, later editions of the text omit the quotation marks in the title.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Vol. VII: Fire, Life, and Magic__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Believed by many to be Serrowen's magnum opus, this work combines the best of the High Sage's understanding of the nature of magical fire with his broad theoretical knowledge of magic itself. In its pages, the author draws parallels between natural fire, magical fire, animating life forces, and the core of magic itself. A dense and difficult text, it nevertheless represents some of the finest scholarship from a lifetime of study in the field. Few claim to have read the volume from cover to cover, but those who have are invariably among the most powerful practitioners of fire magic.

__Serrowen's Dissertations on Elemental Fire Magic Appendix: Enchantments, Instruments, and Artifacts__
*Arthur Mendalon Serrowen, half-elven High Sage of the Magical Arts, College of Elemental Magic, Nevereth Royal University of Magical Studies*
Only included as an appendix to later editions, Serrowen's index of magical items involving fire was tragically incomplete at the time of his death. The text was clearly designed to consist of three sections. The first is a review of common and uncommon magical items using fire. The second is a discussion of a few of the better known magical artifacts using fire. The third is a theoretical treatise on magical frameworks for constructing these items. Rumors suggest that one of Serrowen's students may have stolen a more complete version of the final text just prior to his death.

__Ready Mindflayer One__

__The Joy of Sects__
*Dragar Darkstone, human warlock and high priest of the Old Ones*
Legendary warlock Dargar Darkstone recounts his time in a Cult of the Old Ones, and how it gave the parentless human some much-needed direction, as well as lifelong friendships. A heartwarming tale found in all good bookstores.

__Mystery, Magic & Miracle: Religion in the Age of Humanity__
*by Thimoth Learic*
A study on how magic and faith changed in the dawn of the human pantheon. Prior to humans becoming a predominant race in the world, the majority of the other races had monotheistic religions and magic was simply an extension of the god's will. However, with the rise of the human pantheon, faith and magic became further separated and the will of the gods became fragmented into different entities.

__Forster's Guide to the Lesser Fair-Folk of Seraelden's Glade__
*by Alberich "Albie" Forster, Assistant to the Associate Record Keeper of the Emerald Enclave*
A truly ponderous and horrifically overwritten tome, FGttLFFoSG is a meticulous and painstakingly detailed overview of the lifestyle, culture, biology, and history of a small clan of pixies native to a remote and unremarkable grove in a little-traveled region of the Feywild. Being several thousand pages long and bound in thick leather with iron fittings, the tome is dramatically more useful as a doorstop or improvised weapon than a reference guide, given the absurd granularity of its subject.[Forster got a reputation for producing this kind of meticulous and, arguably, impressive work that nonetheless was very much worse than useless, and so was sent out by the Enclave on increasingly absurd snipe-hunts, each of which produced a volume more ridiculously particular and pointless than the last. Ironically, because only one copy of each work was ever produced, a brutal, vicious, and unbelievably rich collecters' market has arisen in the centuries since Forster's death with each anonymous collecter seeking to assemble the complete set, by any means necessary. 

__Catchy Harmonics as Spell Mnemonics__
*Rimnjim Gnollbane, halfling bard, made famous by Catchy Harmonics as Spell Mnemonics*
A thick book of sheet music. Each song has accompanying lyrics and details on how those lyrics translate into mnemonics for remembering spellcrafting methods. Unfortunately, the songs and mnemonics are quite long and rarely does a spellcaster find it less tedious to remember the song. A few songs do stick in ones head and some readers have gleaned a new spell from its pages. Mostly, it's a common birthday present for any grandchild whose going to grow up to be "grandma's favourite wizard".

__The Lion, the Witch, and the War-forged__

__The Vokhoriad__
*Anonymous*
An epic dwarven poem that originated in oral tradition, passed down through the centuries until it was finally transcribed by a runesmith named Storvi Stonequill. It tells in ponderous, long-winded verse the story of the dwarven citadel Vokhor, which was destroyed by elves near the end of the creation wars. It is a tragic and haunting tale of brave dwarf soldiers led to ruin by a weak king's folly.

__Adventurers in the Wild: A Practical Survival Guide for Commoners__
*By Clement Bosunsmate, tavern owner from Waterdeep and seventeen time unwilling hostage.*
This is a book of practical tips for avoiding contact with adventuring parties. From the best techniques for diving into a bale of hay, to making your house or shop look less interesting, this guide aims to aid common folk in the inevitable event they find themselves in proximity to one of the many dangerous companies of adventurers. Of particular note is a section dealing with identifying and disposing of arcane artifacts and how to locate a village least likely to be the site of demonic horrors.

__Forgeries and Fanaticism: Never Waste a Crisis of Faith__
*Perwid Crashdawn, High Priest*
A short and cynical treatise on using trying times to turn the common people to one's will. The subjects are divided down into though, action, and outcome, sometimes summarized with bullet points. The writer is long dead, having been victim to a coup d'etat organized along the book's lines. Existing copies are often found as a hand-copied sheaf of notes on the table of a would-be dictator, but libraries which specialize in social studies or collecting as many writings as possible are certain to have at least one copy.

__The Infinite Joy of Husbandry__
*Allen "The Man of Tools" Taylor, Human, Woodsman and Handyman*
It can be found in many libraries as it is among the most common for general handyman work, such as crafting and repairing wagons, chairs, furniture, sewing seeds and farming, how to build a basic irrigation system, things of that nature.

__To Kill a Manticore__

__Rock, paper, goblin: 50 educational games and songs for children__
*Vincent of Erdis, scholar at the Temple of Light*
A collection of games and songs for children that teach them about the dangers of the outside world and why they should fear it. It contains such classics as "Rock, paper, goblin", "Tick, tac, terrasque", "Little red riding hood and the big bad warg" as well as 30 completely original games and songs.

__Everything You Never Really Wanted To Know About Draconic Reproduction, But Are Going To Learn Anyway By Reading This Book__
*Migulio Candlechin, gnomish wanderer-bard, First and only Graduate of the College of Suraz*
Despite the rakish title, it's a scholarly work dealing with the ecology of dragons; where they like to nest, their mating habits, how to best ensure the eggs hatch, etcetera. One chapter does describe "the acts", in even more detached clinical detail than the rest of the tome, albeit with little vomiting faces drawn in the margins.

__Where the Gold Flows Freely__
*Airedhel Orson, human economist*
A book about taxation and trade, examining the various economic models of cities on the Sword Coast. It's a dry read even if you're interested in economics. For the unschooled, it's best used as a doorstop.

__Our Friends Below: The Art of Demon-Summoning__
*Tousba Autumnridge, senior Demonologist-in-good-standing, Faerûn Commission of Outreach and Tourism*
The book is, upon first opening it, blank. This has, not surprisingly, affected its sales. However, pages can be revealed through a series of rituals and bargains. The first page, usually activated through a paper cut, will reveal how to access other portions of the book. By the time you get to the end, your soul will almost certainly be the property of several malevolent entities, but the payoff is, we are assured, worth it.

__Planar-shifting for People in a Hurry__

__All That Glitters__
*Haley Pridedraft*
