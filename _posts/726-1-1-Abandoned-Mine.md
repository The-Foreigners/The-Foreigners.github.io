Awoke after a night of celebration bound to pillars.  A dwarf captive was killed by two goblins and thrown off the edge to four worgs waiting below. We broke free and overpowered the goblins looting a dagger and a club. We fed the corpses to the worgs. We surprised the door guards, and again fed the worgs. Found a blade trap in the hallway. Lured another goblin into the hallway and one-shooted him, snuck into the room and killed two goblins. Found numerous bedrolls and a set of rail tracks leading through the room.

Set the goblins in their beds, and moved into the stable room. Tried to ambush the beastmaster in an adjacent room, but we were noticed. After a hard fight, we looted some leather armor and an ornate whip. We barracaded ourselves into the room for a short rest. In this room the tracks enter and descend under the dirt floor. Worked way out to cave entrance, and alerted two goblins. Found Zera and Sorren's backpacks. Circled back through the armory where we found a greatclub, warhammer, longsword, and two shields along with 100g and a pearl. We recovered the dwarf's corpse who was wearing a rope necklace with a jade cresent moon. Exited the cave and came across the remaining two goblins atop worgs. Afterwards, we found my mule baying in the bushes.
