## Sorren Barrelband
#### Life Cleric - Hill Dwarf

Sorren's bright eyes and friendly demeanor belies his age. While most dwarven beards are highly styled he wears his closely cropped, and his complexion is rather tan for a dwarf. Overall he gives the appearance of a short stocky man.
 
As a dispossessed "dirtwalker", Sorren spent his early years as an itinerant metalsmith. Wandering between rural communities, living off the land, repairing household goods and farm implements. His worldly wisdom lead him to serve as a cleric of Chauntea; goddess of agriculture. He was known for solving many troubles of the commonfolk: corralling a stubborn mule, lancing a boil, or providing insight and guidance about a troubled marriage or a blighted crop. Though starting his practice calving, he became a local legend of sorts after delivering many generations of farming peasants where he could often be heard kicking of his legendary birthday celebrations with, "Bring clean linens, hot water, and two casks of ale!"

However, playing the local lush is a ruse, a cover. Sorren is part of a secret order of Chauntea devotees committed to preserving the lives of half-orc newborns which are not always welcome in the human realm. Despite the cultural enmity dwarfs have for orcs, he is often at hand to spirit the infants to safety in Orcish territory.

Mutual admiration for a paladin’s devotion or a cleric’s inspiration make for strong friendships, but a drunk dwarf and a soldier are often fast drinking buddies. Sorren befriended Thayne in the hope of negotiating passage through Thanye’s previously guarded sector in an effort to create a new smuggling route.

Sorren’s order is better known amongst the half-orc bands, as there are few travelers into their territory; especially ones that show up with infant half-orcs. Gringur recognized Sorren and seeks knowledge of her father’s whereabouts.
